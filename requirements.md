# Software Requirements for Chess Arcade

### Vision

We want to extend the chess board logic to a fully-playable game.. In expanding the chess board, we seek to create all of the chess pieces and their moves alongside creating an interactive/arcade-style theme for the user. In doing this, we will be able to flush out a game that users can play virtually just as if they were to play chess on an actual board.


### Pain Point

The pain point that this project solves is when you want to play chess but you are in quarentine and cant leave your house.

# Non-Functional Requirements

This project requires problem-solving and critical-thinking to properly create the chess board logic. It requires the creators to pay close attention to detail since there are any possibilities/edge cases to consider when making the chess game. It also bolsters an entertainment factor where users can tinker with the game moves and ultimately try to win.
